        <p>There are a lot of great things to do in Wales, from the hiking to the coast to learning about the culture, however there are a few things that tourists should know before they visit Wales, so they don't get in to any predicaments. These are the Don'ts of Visiting Wales. Looking at what not to wear, to what not to bring, to what not to do this will help any visitor to Snowdonia, to Pembrokeshire, to Brecon, to Cardiff and more.
